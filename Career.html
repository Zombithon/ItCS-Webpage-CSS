	<h4>"There are career paths that allow you to keep coding up to very senior levels. Most technical startup founders code, and both founders and early employees usually end up in senior roles if the company is successful. Big companies also have technical positions up to SVP level (usually called senior fellow or similar). Obviously as seniority grows, responsibilites tend to evolve from coding, to system design and architecture and then to overall  technical leadership. In some organizations, technical leadership roles are combined with engineering management even at high levels. In some they are distinct. In most organizations, developer team leads also do technical work, but engineering VPs do not, but this isn't universal in either case. You see 'architect" bandied around as a job title, but for the most part this is just a senior development job, not a distinct thing."</h4><br/>
